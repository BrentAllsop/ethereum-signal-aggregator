# Nov 26 \(Retro\)

### Great:

* product is up and looks great
* daily updates were motivating

### To be improved

* we haven't managed to finish all stories
* we haven't foreseen the need / budget for the server
* the tasks were not described well, better descriptions will help
* some things were left out, not being described in details

### To do

* more time on features description and prioritization
