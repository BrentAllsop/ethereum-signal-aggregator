## Max / List prev votes \(carbon vote\)

Playing with the carbon vote \(on fees\) – trying to extract more data.

## Bohdan / Amazon account for backups

$1/mo. – use Max Card for that

## Max / Use of funds from grants

Ask to wait with dev funding before decided with Hudson

Feel free to request funds for the community work for upcoming months.

@AragonFundraising – Dani/AragonBlack can help. 

@Moloch – need to make a proposal

## Max / Customer interviews

Make a specific set of questions for the customer interviews.
