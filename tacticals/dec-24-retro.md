# Dec 24 \(Retro\)

Demo – completed

Retro

* James happy with the work, not happy with the financial situation. Need a time to discuss admin stuff
* Bohdan: like the project, everything was ok, don't want to stop.
* Max: Bohdan work is really neat, marketing and financial can be better

What do we do next

* Aragon grant pieces – gas voting, security & perfomance testing is missing
* budget – publish, wait for Eth, than plan on next steps
* giveth app – we can try Aragon DAO instead \(multisig\)
