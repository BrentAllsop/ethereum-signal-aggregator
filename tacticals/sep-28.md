        <p><b>Anna:</b> argument against hive.one, for the shipped product. Some groups
          are angry about being ranked, want an opt-out. Twitter already does it,
          many users play the game. Our project purpose was never to define who's
          important. We're experimenting with the system. We need to bring core devs
          as advisors, if we're not working with them – we won't accomplish much.

        <p><b>James:</b> we're going to stick to primary sources only, we won't link
          to else. The ranking list won't be the first view of the stances. Ranking
          is not important, but understanding the very top thinks in 1 way, and the
          bottom in another provides some info. If hive.one decides to exclude people
          it would be the same in our app, if smbd decides to go private – we respect
          that as well. We'll be looking for other alternatives as well. No our opt-out
          for now, as we have no control over that.
