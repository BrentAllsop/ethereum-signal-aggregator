# MGP-X: $9600 for EthSignals

## The ask

EthSignals Team \(Max Semenchuk, Bohdan Malkebych, Anett Rolíková\) are requesting funds on improving of Ethereum governance through increasing the volume of signaling around EIPs and general governance stances. This is done through the app called [Tennagraph](https://tennagraph.com/) that is the hub for collecting the community sentiment \(support or opposition\) to specific proposals. It provides perspectives through:

* Coinvoting
* Gas Voting
* Rated influencer stances

## Background

The project started from the [Phil Lucsok and Griff Green presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bQiSw8UveVT_R2f3Yhla61ad6FRefptf/view) on July 2018. The working group was formed shortly. The project was funded on [Giveth](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b51bdbdf8ba4732631989f5) by Griff Green, then with the [Aragon Nest grant](https://github.com/aragon/nest/pull/66) and later on [GitCoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/85/tennagraph-minimum-bias-ethereum-signal-aggregat-2) and [WeTrust](https://cryptounlocked.wetrust.io/tennagraph). Collectively over $43k was attracted for the development and community work. Currently, we have no legal entity and the funds are managed through the [EthSignals DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/tenna.aragonid.eth/0x77886861218199f5d98c86f4e707a071cbb82ea5).

## Scope of Work

Our task is to help Ethereum Core devs, Ethereum Magicians and Ethereum Foundation to collect and analyze signals around the governance by

* Add a plugin for Chrome to[ inject voting mechanics in EIP github interface](https://www.figma.com/file/X4cetH8WVlTP3w0XmbgsEwFN/Tennagraph?node-id=896%3A1239)

  * Add “about” 
  * Add FAQs
  * Short description of EIP - but you can click on it and see it full afterwards 
  * Add socials - twitter & telegram
* Creating more awareness about most important EIPs, importance of signaling, and Tennagraph as the tool to use
  * Doing promotional campaigns in Twitter on specific EIPs \(e.g. [EIP-1559](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1559-fee-market-change-for-eth-1-0-chain/2783/8)\)
  * Manual verification and attaching influencers stances to Tenna
  * Engaging the EIP writers in signaling promotion
  * Including overview/links in relevant media \(coindesk, eth website, [eth github](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Governance-compendium) and satellite resources\)
  * Arrange talks on the conferences \(e.g. web3, ethBerlin, magicians\) & podcasts \(e.g. Zero Knowledge\)
  * Allow setting signal collection bounties from EF and other parties
  * Attract advisors into popularization
  * Create an agreement with major dapps dev on signaling
  * Making public report on the work

## Preliminary monthly budget allocation
