# Jan 14

**James:** Work to be done before we all it done. Testing for security, perfomance testing.   
@Security test – we can ask somebody \(like Dean\) but payment can't be done without budget. James will ask.  
@SSL certificate – James will provide access to the namecheap  
@Perfomance – we can calculate current load and predict. Bohdan will provide info \(stats in PDF maybe\)

**Max:** Payments. James will ask for the last payment before the bonus. Max will ask Griff and setup Aragon DAO. 2 of 4: Bohdan, James, Max, Griff.

**Bohdan:** If we do small tasks – when? We can answer the tickets, but not adding much of improvements.

**Max:** Aracon presentation. James can send for support or feedback.
