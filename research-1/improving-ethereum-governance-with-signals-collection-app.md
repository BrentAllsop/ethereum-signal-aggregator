# Improving Ethereum Governance with Signals Collection App

### Ethereum Stakeholders

1. EF
2. Core devs
3. Dapp devs \(Parity, Status, Gnosis, Giveth, Aragon, Exchanges\)
4. Miners
5. Users
6. Researchers

### Need Hypotheses

* Better signal collection can help improving ambiguous proposals \(EIPs\)
* EF / Ethereum Dev Call Faci / Coordinator \(Hudson Jameson\) needs a tool for easier community stances collection
* Major DApp devs want to have a say in the Ethereum roadmap development \(1 confirm\)
* Miners want to participate in the governance

## Solutions Hypotheses

* [https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs)
* Twitter polls and discussions
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/)
* Magicians community \(forum + meetings\)
* Tennagraph
  * Ask fro twitter API 
  * Introduce identity tenna
* [Ethereum Governance Survey](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-governance-survey-call-to-action/3137)
* Futarchy / Prediction markets

## Feedback

So here are a few pieces of feedback: Under Ethereum Stakeholders there are a few groups missing. I list a lot of the stakeholders on this slide deck I made about governance on slide 6:[ https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eT6vM0TdTFtrD6EAH3FHp30ymn7XgyodlILlBH53ifc/edit?usp=sharing â€¦](https://t.co/ME9mygqwPd) Under Need Hypotheses I would say that needing better signal collection is neccessary because the more signals we have the harder it is for an adversary to game all of the signals at once. It is also true that I could use a tool to quickly aggregate consensus around a topic.
