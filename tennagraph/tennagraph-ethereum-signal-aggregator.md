## **Freeform Vision**

We need a website in the community that we can trust - a fairly high source of truth in terms of recognized people and their skill sets. The main point is to get a website that curates signals of high source of truth which can be used to get an overview of the overall community and its health. List of signals that are helpful and will help to pinpoint what the state of the community really is.

The end goal is a community-curated hub that clears out some of the noise around key developments and decisions facing Ethereum

### Core Guiding Principals

* Coverage: Cover as many stakeholders with as wide a variety of signals as possible.
* Direct Representation: Little to no interpretation of data.
* Integration over Recreation: Work with partners from the community where technologies already exist.
* Community: Encourage meaningful participation from the community to update and govern the website.
* Historical Data Transparency: Leave a record of what happened to help researchers and historians.

### Needs
